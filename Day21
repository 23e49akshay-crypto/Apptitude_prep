1️⃣ STATISTICS – MEAN, MEDIAN, MODE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Statistics questions are common in placements, especially in:

Data Interpretation

Analytical rounds

🔹 A. MEAN (AVERAGE)
📌 Formula:

Mean=
Number of observations
Sum of observations
	​

🔹 Example 1

Find mean of: 5, 10, 15, 20

Sum = 50
Count = 4


Mean=50/4=12.5
🔹 Shortcut Formula (Very Useful)

If numbers are:

a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d (AP)

Mean = Middle value (if even, average of two middle values)

🔹 B. MEDIAN

Median = Middle value after arranging data in order

🔹 Example 2

Find median of: 8, 3, 10, 5, 6

Arrange: 3, 5, 6, 8, 10

Middle = 6

If even numbers:

Example: 2, 4, 6, 8

Median = (4 + 6)/2 = 5

🔹 C. MODE

Mode = Most frequently occurring value

🔹 Example 3

2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3

Mode = 3

🔹 D. COMBINED MEAN (PLACEMENT FAVORITE)
🔹 Example 4

Average of 10 students = 60
Average of 20 students = 70

Find combined average.


(10×60)+(20×70)
	​

=
600
+
1400
30
=
30
600+1400
	​

=
2000
/
30
=
66.67
=2000/30=66.67

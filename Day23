1️⃣ DATA INTERPRETATION – BASICS (TABLES & CHARTS)

Data Interpretation (DI) tests:

Speed

Accuracy

Logical calculation

Many placement exams include 1 full DI set (4–6 questions).

🔹 A. WHAT IS DATA INTERPRETATION?

You are given:

A table / bar graph / pie chart

Some numerical data

You must:

Calculate

Compare

Analyze

🔹 B. TABLE-BASED DI (MOST COMMON)
Example Data:
Year	Sales (₹ in lakhs)
2020	100
2021	120
2022	150
2023	130
🔹 Example 1

What is total sales from 2020–2023?

100
+
120
+
150
+
130
=
500
100+120+150+130=500

Answer = 500 lakhs

🔹 Example 2

Percentage increase from 2020 to 2022?

Increase = 150 − 100 = 50

50
100
×
100
=
50
%
100
50
	​

×100=50%
🔹 Example 3

Average sales over 4 years?

500
/
4
=
125
500/4=125
🔹 C. COMMON TYPES OF QUESTIONS

Total

Average

Percentage increase/decrease

Ratio comparison

Highest/Lowest value

🔹 D. SPEED STRATEGY (VERY IMPORTANT)

First read all questions

Avoid unnecessary calculation

Use approximation when allowed

Don’t get stuck on one question

📝 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

Using the above table:

In which year was sales highest?

What is percentage decrease from 2022 to 2023?

What is ratio of sales in 2021 and 2023?

What is difference between highest and lowest year?

If next year grows by 20% from 2023, what will be sales?

1️⃣ PERMUTATION & COMBINATION – ADVANCED

Today we cover:

Circular permutation

Special cases

Repetition cases

These are very common in placement exams.

🔹 A. CIRCULAR PERMUTATION

When objects are arranged in a circle, formula changes.

📌 Formula:

For n different objects arranged in a circle:

(𝑛−1)!
(n−1)!
🔹 Example 1

In how many ways can 4 people sit around a round table?

(4−1)!=3!=6
🔹 Example 2

5 people around a circular table?


(5−1)!=4!=24
🔹 B. ARRANGEMENT WITH IDENTICAL OBJECTS

Formula:

𝑛!𝑝!𝑞!𝑟!
p!q!r!
n!
	​


(where p, q, r are repeated items)

🔹 Example 3

How many arrangements of word “LEVEL”?

Letters: L, E, V, E, L
Total letters = 5
L repeats 2 times
E repeats 2 times

5!2!2!2!2!5!
	​

=
120
4
=
30
=
4
120
	​

=30
🔹 C. SELECTION WITH REPETITION

If repetition allowed:

𝑛𝐶𝑟=(𝑛+𝑟−1)!𝑟!(𝑛−1)!nCr	​
=
r!(n−1)!
(n+r−1)!
	​

🔹 Example 4

In how many ways can 3 chocolates be chosen from 5 types (repetition allowed)?

5𝐶3=(5+3−1)!3!(5−1)!5C3	​=
3!(5−1)!
(5+3−1)=7𝐶3=35=7C3
	​

=35
🔹 D. IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE

Linear arrangement → n!
Circular arrangement → (n − 1)!

📝 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

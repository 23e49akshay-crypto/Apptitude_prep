1️⃣ PROBABILITY – CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY (ADVANCED)

This is a very important placement topic.
Many companies test whether you truly understand probability.

🔹 A. WHAT IS CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY?

Conditional probability means:

👉 Probability of event A, given that event B has already happened.

📌 Formula:
𝑃(𝐴∣𝐵)z𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)𝑃(𝐵)
P(A∣B)=
P(B)
P(A∩B)
	​

🔹 B. BASIC UNDERSTANDING

“Given B happened” means:
We restrict our sample space to B only.

🔹 Example 1 (Cards)

From a deck of 52 cards:

What is probability that a card is a King, given that it is a face card?

Face cards = 12 (J, Q, K)
Kings = 4


P(K∣Face)=
12
4
	​

=
3
1
	​

🔹 C. INDEPENDENT EVENTS

If A and B are independent:


P(A∣B)=P(A)

Example:
Coin toss does not affect dice roll.

🔹 D. BAYES’ TYPE QUESTION (COMMON)
🔹 Example 2

A bag has:

3 red balls

2 blue balls

If one ball is drawn, probability it is red given that it is not blue?

Not blue means red only.

P(Red∣Not Blue)=1
🔹 E. MULTI-STEP QUESTION
🔹 Example 3

Two cards drawn without replacement.

Probability that second card is Ace given first card was Ace?

Total aces = 4

After first Ace removed:

Remaining cards = 51
Remaining aces = 3

𝑃=351=117
P=513=171

1️⃣ NUMBER SYSTEM – RECURRING DECIMALS & COMPARISON (NEW TOPIC)

This topic checks:

Concept clarity

Fraction–decimal understanding

Logical comparison (very common in placements)

🔹 A. WHAT ARE RECURRING DECIMALS?

A recurring (repeating) decimal has digits that repeat forever.

Examples:

0.333… = 0.3̅

0.666… = 0.6̅

0.121212… = 0.12̅

🔹 B. CONVERSION (MOST IMPORTANT)
Rule 1: Single Digit Repeating

0.3̅ = 3/9 = 1/3
0.6̅ = 6/9 = 2/3
0.9̅ = 9/9 = 1

📌 Very common interview fact:
👉 0.9̅ = 1

🔹 Example 1

Convert 0.7̅ into fraction.

0.7̅ = 7/9

✅ Answer = 7/9

🔹 C. DOUBLE DIGIT RECURRING

Example:
0.12̅ = 12/99 = 4/33

🔹 Example 2

Convert 0.45̅ into fraction.

45/99 → divide by 9
= 5/11

🔹 D. COMPARISON TRICK (VERY USEFUL)

Compare: 0.6̅ and 0.7

0.6̅ = 2/3 ≈ 0.666
0.7 = 0.700

👉 0.7 is greater

🔹 Example 3 (Tricky)

Which is greater: 0.3̅ or 0.34

0.3̅ = 1/3 ≈ 0.333
0.34 = 0.340

👉 0.34 is greater

📝 PRACTICE QUESTIONS

Convert 0.4̅ into fraction

Convert 0.81̅ into fraction

Which is greater: 0.5̅ or 0.55

Which is greater: 0.6̅ or 0.66

Is 0.9̅ equal to 1? (Explain)

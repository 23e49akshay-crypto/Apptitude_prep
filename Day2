1️⃣ NUMBER SYSTEM – ADVANCED (REMAINDERS & LAST DIGIT)

This area is very important for placement exams because questions are short but tricky.

🔹 A. REMAINDER CONCEPT (Deep Explanation)
📌 Basic Rule

When a number A is divided by B:

A = B × Q + R
Where R = remainder and
👉 R is always less than B

🔹 Example 1 (Basic)

Find remainder when 38 ÷ 7

7 × 5 = 35
38 − 35 = 3

✅ Remainder = 3

🔹 Example 2 (Big Number Trick)

Find remainder when 123 ÷ 9

Rule:
If sum of digits divisible by 9 → number divisible by 9

1 + 2 + 3 = 6
6 ÷ 9 ❌

👉 Remainder = 6

🔹 Example 3 (Power Remainder – Important)

Find remainder when 2⁵ ÷ 3

2⁵ = 32
32 ÷ 3 → remainder 2

✅ Answer = 2

🔹 B. LAST DIGIT CONCEPT

Used when numbers are very large.

📌 Trick

Last digits repeat in a cycle.

Example for 2:
2¹ → 2
2² → 4
2³ → 8
2⁴ → 6
(Repeat every 4)

🔹 Example 4

Find last digit of 2¹⁰

Cycle length = 4
10 ÷ 4 → remainder = 2

So last digit = 4

🔹 Example 5 (Very Common)

Find last digit of 7³⁵

Cycle of 7:
7, 9, 3, 1

35 ÷ 4 → remainder = 3
3rd number in cycle = 3

✅ Answer = 3

📝 PRACTICE QUESTIONS (WITH PURPOSE)

Find remainder when 57 ÷ 8

Find remainder when 256 ÷ 9

Find last digit of 3¹⁷

Find last digit of 9⁴⁶

Find remainder when 5⁷ ÷ 4

1️⃣ PROBABILITY – BASICS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Probability is directly connected to Permutation & Combination.
Many companies ask at least 1 question from this topic.

🔹 A. WHAT IS PROBABILITY?

Probability measures the chance of an event happening.

📌 Formula:
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦=𝐹𝑎𝑣𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑠
Probability=
Total Outcomes
Favourable Outcomes
	​


Value is always between 0 and 1.

🔹 B. BASIC EXAMPLES
🔹 Example 1 (Coin)

What is probability of getting Head?

Total outcomes = {H, T} = 2
Favourable = {H} = 1

𝑃=12P=21
	​

🔹 Example 2 (Dice)

Probability of getting 4?

Total outcomes = 6
Favourable = 1

𝑃=16P=61
	​

🔹 C. PROBABILITY OF NOT HAPPENING
𝑃(𝑁𝑜𝑡 𝐴)=1−𝑃(𝐴)
P(Not A)=1−P(A)
🔹 Example 3

Probability of NOT getting 6 on dice?

1−16=561−61	​=65
	​

🔹 D. MULTIPLE EVENTS (IMPORTANT)

If events are independent:

𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴)×𝑃(𝐵)
P(A∩B)=P(A)×P(B)
🔹 Example 4

Probability of getting:
Head AND 4 (coin + dice)

=12×16=21	​×61
	​


= 1/12

🔹 E. USING COMBINATION
🔹 Example 5

From 5 red and 3 blue balls, probability of selecting 2 red?

Total ways:

8𝐶28C2
	​


Favourable:

5𝐶25C2	​𝑃=5𝐶28𝐶2P=8C2	​5C2	​	​=1028=514=281	​=145
	​

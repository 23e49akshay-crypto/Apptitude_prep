1️⃣ NUMBER SYSTEM – FOUNDATION (Deep Explanation)
🔹 What is Number System?

Number System questions test:

Calculation ability

Logical thinking

Speed & accuracy

These are very common in placement aptitude tests.

🔹 Types of Numbers (Very Important)
1. Natural Numbers

👉 1, 2, 3, 4, …
Used for counting.

2. Whole Numbers

👉 0, 1, 2, 3, …
Includes zero.

3. Integers

👉 … -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 …

4. Prime Numbers

👉 Numbers having only 2 factors (1 and itself)
Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11

⚠️ 2 is the only even prime number

5. Composite Numbers

👉 Numbers having more than 2 factors
Examples: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10

🔹 Example 1 (Prime or Not)

Is 31 a prime number?

Check divisibility by:
2 ❌
3 ❌
5 ❌

No other factors → 31 is PRIME ✅

🔹 LCM & HCF (Most Asked)
🔸 HCF (Highest Common Factor)

Largest number that divides both numbers.

🔸 LCM (Least Common Multiple)

Smallest number divisible by both numbers.

🔹 Example 2 (Step-by-step)

Find HCF and LCM of 20 and 30

20 = 2 × 2 × 5
30 = 2 × 3 × 5

HCF = 2 × 5 = 10
LCM = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60

🔹 Divisibility Rules (Must Remember)

Divisible by 2 → last digit even

Divisible by 3 → sum of digits divisible by 3

Divisible by 5 → last digit 0 or 5

Divisible by 9 → sum of digits divisible by 9

🔹 Example 3

Is 7,236 divisible by 3?

7 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 18
18 ÷ 3 = 6

✅ Yes, divisible by 3

🔹 Remainder Concept
Example 4

Find remainder when 47 ÷ 6

6 × 7 = 42
47 − 42 = 5

Remainder = 5

📝 PRACTICE (Very Important)

Is 41 prime or composite?

Find HCF of 18 and 27

Find LCM of 8 and 12

Is 5,472 divisible by 9?

Find remainder when 89 ÷ 7

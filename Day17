1️⃣ PERMUTATION & COMBINATION – BASICS (VERY IMPORTANT)

This is one of the most important placement topics.
Many companies ask at least 1–2 questions from here.

🔹 A. PERMUTATION (ARRANGEMENT)

Permutation is used when order matters.

Example:
Arranging 3 students in 3 chairs.

Formula:

𝑛𝑃𝑟=𝑛!(𝑛−𝑟)!nPr	​=(n−r)!n!	​
🔹 Factorial Concept (Must Know)
5!=5×4×3×2×1=120
5!=5×4×3×2×1=120
0
!
=
1
0!=1
🔹 Example 1

In how many ways can 3 letters be arranged from A, B, C?

3
!
=
6
3!=6

Arrangements:
ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA

🔹 Example 2

Find value of:

5𝑃25P2	​=5!3!=3!5!	​=5×4×3!3!=3!
5×4×3!
	​


= 20

🔹 B. COMBINATION (SELECTION)

Combination is used when order does NOT matter.

Formula:

𝑛𝐶𝑟=𝑛!𝑟!(𝑛−𝑟)!nCr=r!(n−r)!n!
	​

🔹 Example 3

In how many ways can 2 students be selected from 4?

4𝐶2=4!2!2!4z2	​=2!2!4!	​=244=424	​= 6

🔹 C. IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE

Permutation → Order matters
Combination → Order does not matter

Example:
AB and BA
Permutation → different
Combination → same

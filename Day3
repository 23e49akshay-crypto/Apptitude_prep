NUMBER SYSTEM – UNITS DIGIT & CYCLICITY (ADVANCED)

These questions are very common in campus placements because they test speed + logic.

🔹 A. UNITS DIGIT CONCEPT (Deeply Explained)

The units digit is the last digit of a number.

Example:

Units digit of 345 → 5

Units digit of 1028 → 8

When powers are involved, digits repeat in cycles.

🔹 B. CYCLE OF DIGITS (MUST MEMORIZE)
🔸 Cycle of 2

2 → 4 → 8 → 6 (repeats every 4)

🔸 Cycle of 3

3 → 9 → 7 → 1 (repeats every 4)

🔸 Cycle of 7

7 → 9 → 3 → 1 (repeats every 4)

🔸 Cycle of 9

9 → 1 (repeats every 2)

🔹 Example 1 (Step-by-step)

Find the units digit of 3²³

Cycle length = 4
23 ÷ 4 → remainder = 3

3rd number in cycle of 3 = 7

✅ Answer = 7

🔹 Example 2 (Tricky)

Find units digit of 9⁵⁷

Cycle of 9 = 9, 1
57 is odd

So units digit = 9

🔹 Example 3 (Combined Concept)

Find units digit of (7²⁴ + 3¹⁵)

7²⁴ → 24 ÷ 4 = 0 → units digit = 1
3¹⁵ → 15 ÷ 4 = 3 → units digit = 7

Add: 1 + 7 = 8

✅ Answer = 8

📝 PRACTICE QUESTIONS
